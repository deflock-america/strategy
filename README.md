## 🏛️ Supreme Court Path

**$100B+ class action exposure** → *Carpenter v. US* extension

Norfolk case (526 hits/4 months) = perfect vehicle for cert petition

**Timeline:** District court → Appeal → Circuit decision → SCOTUS cert (4 years)

## 6 Immediate Tactics

1. **Mass FOIA Campaign** — Washington precedent: data = public record[web:27]
2. **Municipal Budget Defunding** — Denver model: council blocked renewal[web:26]
3. **Corporate Accountability** — $7.5B valuation target; SEC complaints; investor pressure
4. **Sympathetic Plaintiff Recruitment** — Abortion seekers, DV survivors, immigrants, protesters[web:36]
5. **State AG Investigations** — CA, IL precedents already filed
6. **DeFlock.me Expansion** — Camera mapping platform + FOIA transparency

## Legal Foundation

**Post-*Carpenter v. United States* (2018):**
- Warrantless location tracking = Fourth Amendment violation[web:19][web:20]
- Flock captures MORE granular data than cell-site records
- Network effects create comprehensive movement histories
- Federal/state access = state action liability

**Carpenter was 5-4. Flock is worse. Momentum building. Act now.**
