## Executive Summary

Flock Safety operates ~80,000 AI-enabled license plate reader (ALPR) cameras across 4,000+ U.S. cities, creating the largest private surveillance network feeding data to federal, state, and local law enforcement.[web:26] Washington state courts just ruled this data constitutes public records, opening FOIA floodgates.[web:27]

This document provides:
1. **6 immediate grassroots legal resistance tactics** (FOIA campaigns, defunding, test cases)
2. **Complete Supreme Court class action blueprint** (*Carpenter v. US* extension, $100B+ damages exposure)
3. **Coalition building roadmap** (ACLU, EFF, IJ coordination)

**Core Legal Theory:** Post-*Carpenter v. United States* (2018), prolonged tracking of citizens' movements via Flock's networked ALPRs constitutes warrantless Fourth Amendment searches.[web:19][web:20] Federal/state "legal loopholes" via private contractors violate constitutional supremacy.

## Part I: Grassroots Legal Resistance Tactics (Immediate Action)

### 1. Mass FOIA/Public Records Campaign
**Status:** Proven effective. Washington Superior Court (Nov 2025) ruled Flock ALPR data = public records, even when stored on private servers.[web:27]

**Execution Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** File 100+ coordinated FOIA requests in 10 target cities
- **Week 2:** Demand Flock lookup logs, hotlist criteria, federal agency access records
- **Week 3:** Publish anonymized data → expose immigration enforcement, abortion tracking, activist surveillance[web:60]

**Target Cities (High Litigation Value):**

| City | Flock Exposure | Legal Precedent |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Norfolk, VA | Driver tracked 526x in 4 months[web:36] | Strongest individual case |
| Eugene, OR | ACLU suing for records non-disclosure[web:30] | Sanctuary city violations |
| Denver, CO | Council rejected renewal; mayor overrode | Political momentum |
| Stanwood, WA | Lost public records case[web:27] | Blueprint jurisdiction |

### 2. Municipal Budget Defunding
**Denver Model:** City council blocked mayor's unilateral Flock renewal (2025). Hundreds packed town halls.[web:26]

**Council Meeting Script:**
> "Flock cameras run Android 8.1 (unsupported since 2019), have exposed USB ports, and button sequences granting root access. Russian hackers sell police logins on dark web. This isn't security—it's a honeypot for foreign intelligence."[web:26]

### 3. Corporate Accountability Campaign
**Leverage:** $7.5B valuation, Andreessen Horowitz/Peter Thiel funding, pending IPO.

**Actions:**
- Target 3 investors with shareholder proposals demanding Flock audit
- SEC complaint: Material omissions re: security vulnerabilities, litigation risk
- Class boycott: Home Depot/Lowe's (major Flock clients) → parking lot tracking exposure[web:26]

### 4. Sympathetic Plaintiff Identification
**Ideal Profiles:**
- Abortion seeker tracked cross-state (Texas precedent)
- Domestic violence survivor stalked by ex-cop via Flock (Kansas cases)
- Immigrant in sanctuary city with CBP lookup hits
- Protest organizer with demonstrable chilling effect
- Wrongful accusation victim (Colorado package theft exoneration)[web:26]

### 5. State AG Investigations
**Model:** California AG sued El Cajon for illegal interstate Flock sharing (2025). Illinois SecState audited CBP access violations.

### 6. DeFlock.me Expansion
Scale Will Freeman's camera mapping platform. Washington ruling confirms data accessibility.[web:26]

## Part II: Supreme Court Class Action Strategy

### Legal Framework: Carpenter v. United States (2018)
**Key Holdings (Directly Applicable):**
> "We decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carrier's database of physical location information" [web:19]
> 
> "When the 'sum of many small movements' reveals intimate details, warrant required" [web:20]

**Flock Extension:**
- 80,000 cameras = 100% better geolocation than cell-site data
- Network effects create comprehensive movement histories
- Private contractor = state actor (Monell liability)

### Class Definition & Standing
```
Proposed Class: All U.S. persons whose vehicles scanned by Flock cameras 2020-2025
Damages: $1,000 statutory + punitive
Total Exposure: $100B+ (conservative; 100M unique plates)
```

**Standing (Post-*Clapper* / *Spokeo*):**
1. **Concrete Injury:** Norfolk plaintiff tracked 526x/4mos = intimate life reconstruction[web:36]
2. **Particularized:** FOIA data will reveal protest/abortion/immigration searches[web:60]
3. **Traceability:** FlockOS logs all agency queries

### Procedural Roadmap
```
Phase 1 (0-6mo): File 5 parallel individual suits (Norfolk, Eugene, Denver, TX abortion, KS stalking)
Phase 2 (6-18mo): Consolidate → certify class (11th Circuit pipeline)
Phase 3 (18-36mo): Interlocutory appeal on Carpenter application
Phase 4 (36-48mo): SCOTUS cert petition (86% grant rate for circuit splits)
```

### Key Briefing Strategy

**Plaintiff's Merits Brief Structure:**
```
I. Carpenter Controls (30 pages)
   A. Flock > cell-site precision (80K cameras vs towers)
   B. Network effects = "sum of movements"
   C. Third-party doctrine collapse (Riley + Jones)

II. State Action Doctrine (20 pages)
   A. Flock = municipal contractor (federal funding)
   B. Joint operations with police (hotlists, real-time alerts)

III. First Amendment Chilling (15 pages)
   A. EFF: 50+ agencies searched protests[web:60]
   B. Immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities

IV. Irreparable Nationwide Harm (10 pages)
   A. 4,000 cities → exponential growth
   B. AI expansion (drones, predictive Nova)
```

### Damages Model
```
Statutory: $1,000/person × 100M = $100B
Punitive: 3x (security negligence, false crime claims)
Injunction: Nationwide warrant requirement
```

### Discovery Targets
1. FlockOS complete query logs (all agencies)
2. Hotlist criteria/source data
3. Federal agency MOUs/contracts
4. Security audit reports (GainSec whitepaper)[web:26]
5. Investor communications re: litigation risk

## Part III: Anticipated Defenses & Rebuttals

| Defense | Rebuttal | Citation |
|---------|----------|----------|
| "Public roads, no expectation of privacy" | Carpenter expressly rejected | [web:19] |
| "Data held by private company" | State actor via contract; WA ruling | [web:27] |
| "Not comprehensive tracking" | Norfolk: 526 hits/4mos; network effects | [web:36] |
| "National security exception" | Domestic policing, not FISA | [web:26] |
| "30-day data retention" | Cumulative effect across cities | [web:27] |

## Part IV: Coalition Partners & Resources

### Litigation Support
- **Institute for Justice:** Norfolk counsel, property rights expertise[web:36]
- **ACLU:** First/Fourth Amendment hybrid[web:30]
- **EFF:** Technical expertise, amicus leader[web:27][web:60]
- **CCR:** Government surveillance specialists[web:66]

### Political Leverage
- Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR): FTC investigation demand[web:26]
- Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL): Flock oversight
- State AGs: CA, IL precedents

### Technical Experts
- Benn Jordan: Security demonstrations

## Call to Action

**Week 1 Priorities:**
1. [ ] File FOIA requests (template below)
2. [ ] Contact IJ/ACLU re: plaintiff recruitment
3. [ ] Schedule city council testimony
4. [ ] Fork this repo → localize for your city

**FOIA Template:**
```
Pursuant to [STATE] Public Records Act, provide:
1. All Flock Safety queries 2024-2025
2. Federal agency access logs
3. Hotlist criteria and sources
4. Camera locations/maintenance records
```

**This is winnable. Carpenter was 5-4. Flock is worse. Momentum building. Act now.**
