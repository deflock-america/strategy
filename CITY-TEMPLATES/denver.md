# Denver, Colorado – Flock Safety Status

## 📊 Current Snapshot

- **Flock install date:** May 2024 [web:152]
- **Cameras:** ~111 solar-powered ALPRs at ~70 intersections citywide [web:152][web:159]
- **Original 2‑year extension:** $666,000 (24 months) rejected by City Council in May 2025 [web:159][web:168]
- **Current status:** Mayor unilaterally extended contract for 5 months at no cost, with “Denver-specific safeguards,” over council objections [web:155][web:159]
- **End of current extension:** March 31, 2026 (mayor plans to seek long-term contract afterward) [web:155][web:156]

## 🏛️ Political Landscape

### City Council

- **Council position:** Council unanimously rejected 2‑year paid extension over privacy and immigration concerns [web:159][web:163]
- **Key conflicts:**
  - Mayor extended contract again without council vote or public process, prompting outrage from multiple councilmembers [web:155][web:151][web:164]
  - Some members requested the **city auditor** block the mayor’s Flock maneuver [web:151]
- **Use this angle:** democratic oversight, separation of powers, surveillance without consent.

### Mayor & Police

- **Mayor Mike Johnston:** Pushing “Denver plan” no-cost extension framed as adding guardrails while maintaining Flock network [web:155][web:159][web:165]
- **Denver Police Department (DPD):**
  - Credits Flock with:
    - 352 arrests
    - 39 firearms recovered
    - 250+ stolen vehicles recovered (city release numbers) [web:156]
  - Quietly disabled **national lookup** feature in April 2025 (now limited to statewide lookups) after public outcry [web:155]
  - Actively lobbying that Flock is a “force multiplier” and critical to crime reduction [web:155].

## 🔐 Claimed “Denver Safeguards” (Talking Points)

Under the latest extension, the city claims Flock must: [web:155][web:156][web:165]

- Pay **$100,000 per breach or improper release** of Denver data.
- Allow searches **only for a limited list of crimes**.
- **Ban searches related to immigration and reproductive health care.**
- **Block all federal agencies** from accessing Denver Flock data, even through joint task forces.
- Restrict outgoing/incoming lookups to **statewide only**, no national network sharing.

Use this to argue: “If it was safe before, why did we need all these new guardrails now?”

## ⚖️ Civil Rights & Advocacy Posture

- **ACLU of Colorado** and a coalition of civil rights groups have publicly opposed Denver’s use of Flock, citing:
  - Mass surveillance
  - Potential immigration targeting
  - Lack of transparency and community input [web:169][web:170]
- Community groups have organized town halls and demanded suspension of Flock until a real public process occurs [web:169][web:170].

## 📂 FOIA & Data Work Plan (Denver)

1. **Existing Open Records Leads**
   - Contracts, amendments, and the latest “no-cost extension” terms from city open records [web:155][web:159][web:165].
   - Policies limiting federal access and national network participation.

2. **New FOIA Targets**
   - **Flock query logs**: all searches 2024–present, especially:
     - Any protest-related searches.
     - Immigration-related queries pre‑“safeguards” policy.
   - **Audit logs** of which outside agencies had Denver access before April 2025.
   - **Drone integration**: contracts/MOUs for Flock Aerodome drone pilot with DPD [web:162].

3. **Where to store:**
   - `data/foia-responses/denver/` (raw CSV/JSON/PDF)
   - Summaries in `docs/timeline.md` and `docs/legal-precedents.md`.

## 🗣️ Council Hearing Script (Denver-Optimized)

Use at council public comment or town halls:

> “Council unanimously rejected a $666,000 Flock contract after community outcry, yet the mayor quietly extended it again without a vote or public process.[web:159][web:151] If this technology is so safe, why did Denver suddenly need $100,000 breach penalties, bans on immigration searches, and a shutdown of national data sharing?[web:155][web:156][web:165] Denver residents deserve transparent, warrant-based policing — not unilateral surveillance deals made behind council’s back.”

## ✅ Local Action Checklist – Denver

- [ ] File updated FOIA using `FOIA-TEMPLATE.md` focusing on:
  - Federal access logs prior to April 2025.
  - All uses related to protests, immigration, or reproductive health.
- [ ] Map all 111 cameras via DeFlock.me and cross-check with city releases [web:152][web:159].
- [ ] Recruit Denver plaintiffs:
  - Protesters, immigrants, drivers repeatedly hit by cameras.
- [ ] Support council efforts to:
  - Force public hearings before any **post-March 2026** long-term contract.
  - Codify **no federal access + warrant requirements** into ordinance, not just contract language.
