- **Network Total:** **600+ cameras across Hampton Roads** (Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach) [web:171][web:175]
- **Key Litigation:** **Institute for Justice (IJ) federal lawsuit** against City of Norfolk over **170+ Flock cameras** [web:33]
- **Landmark Case:** Driver tracked **526 times in 4 months** without warrant – perfect Supreme Court vehicle [web:6]

## ⚖️ Litigation Status – Norfolk is Ground Zero

### **Primary Case: IJ v. Norfolk (Federal)**
- **Plaintiff:** Driver tracked **526 times/4 months** = comprehensive movement reconstruction [web:6][web:33]
- **Theory:** Warrantless ALPR tracking violates **Fourth Amendment post-Carpenter**
- **Status:** Active federal litigation. **Camera locations unsealed** (Nov 23, 2025) – first public disclosure [web:171]
- **Strategic Value:** **Perfect class action lead plaintiff** + **exact camera coordinates available**

### **State Appeal: Commonwealth v. Church**
- **Ruling:** VA Court of Appeals **reversed** circuit court warrant requirement (Oct 14, 2025) [web:172]
- **Flock Statement:** "Eliminates only adverse decision nationwide" 
- **Counter:** Creates **circuit split** (4th Circuit vs. Carpenter logic) → **SCOTUS cert path**

## 🏛️ Political Landscape

### City Council
- **Approved casino Flock cameras** (Nov 19, 2025) via consent agenda – **no public discussion** [web:173]
- **Pattern:** Expanding Flock despite federal litigation → **bad faith argument**

### Police Department
- **Core defense:** "Public roads, no warrant needed" [web:172]
- **Virginia Network:** **3,000+ immigration searches** across VA Flock systems despite local promises [web:174][web:176]
