# Carpenter v. US (2018) → Flock Safety Extension Brief

## 🎯 **Core Carpenter Holding**
“Warrantless seizure of cell-site location information (CSLI) constitutes
a search under the 4th Amendment.”[semanticscholar]
KEY: “The fact that information is held by a third party does not by
itself overcome the user’s claim to 4th Amendment protection.”


## 🔍 **Flock > Carpenter (9 Ways)**

| Carpenter | Flock Safety | Constitutional Impact |
|————|—————|-———————|
| **~12,000 points** (7 days) | **526 hits/4 months** (Norfolk) [web:6] | More granular |
| **Cell towers** (~100m accuracy) | **80K cameras** (street-level) | Precise location |
| **Single carrier** | **4,000 agencies** (national network) | Mass surveillance |
| **Historical** | **Real-time alerts** | Immediate tracking |
| **127 days** max | **30+ days** retention + cross-city | Permanent record |

## ⚖️ **Legal Extension Argument**
1.	PRECISION: Flock pinpoints exact intersections vs. tower sectors
2.	COMPREHENSIVENESS: 80K cameras vs. ~300K towers nationwide
3.	NETWORK EFFECTS: Cross-jurisdiction tracking creates “mosaic”
4.	STATE ACTION: Municipal contracts = government surveillance


## 🛑 **Flock Defenses → Rebuttals**

| Flock Argument | Carpenter Rebuttal |
|-—————|-——————|
| “Public roads” | “Individual points public ≠ comprehensive tracking” |
| “Private company” | “Third-party doctrine rejected for location data” |
| “30-day retention” | “Even 7 days triggered warrant requirement” |

## 🚀 **Model SCOTUS Question Presented**
“Whether systematic, warrantless capture and retention of comprehensive
location data through 80,000+ networked ALPR cameras violates the
Fourth Amendment absent a warrant supported by probable cause?”


**Carpenter was 5-4. Flock is 10x worse. Cert grant probable.**
